# Week 3

## Weekly Goals
1. Build a simple web app
2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
4. Explain the MVC pattern


## Plans to achieve:
1. Attend workshop 'Debugging Process'
2. Work through practicals 
3. Research the MVC pattern

## Evidence:
### 1. Build a simple web app
#### Created a birthday app that either prints 'Happy Birthday' or the remaining days left

#### Completed intro_to_the_web challenge

### 2. Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
#### Attended workshop and completed practical with team

### 3. Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
#### Completed Practicals

#### HTTP - request/response 
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) is the protocol for sending a request (from client to server) and getting a response (from server to client).
The two most common HTTP Methods are GET & POST. GET simply returns a page with HTML from a server. POST sends data to server. 

#### HTML
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a markup language that is the bare structure of a webpage. Just like building a house, HTML is the scaffolding that holds everything together.  

#### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to style webpages. Going back to the house analogy, CSS is the wallpaper - purely for decoration. 


### 4. Explain the MVC pattern (Model - View - Controller)
#### Model
The Model is a database that stores data. You can move data in and out form the model.

#### View
The view is what the user see's on their browser. When you read this message you are using a View from GitHub displayed on your browser.

#### Controller
The controller is what links the Model and View together. For example if I was presented a 'View' to enter my name and age, this would be 'POST'ed to the server and then the 'Controller' will store this in the 'Model'.
