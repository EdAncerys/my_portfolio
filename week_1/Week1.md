# Week 1

## Weekly Goals
1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
3. Follow an effective debugging process
4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

## Plans to achieve:
1. Work through Boris Bike Challenge with a new pair every afternoon
2. Attend workshops that are inline with goals
3. Complete Weekend Challenge
4. Work through the practicals

## Evidence:
### 1. Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
#### Created a roman numeral converter/calculator, inputs several numbers and tests output

### 2. Pair using the driver-navigator style
#### Working with three wonderful pair partners to complete the challenges in "Boris Bike"

### 3. Follow an effective debugging process
#### Followed and completed debugging exercise as provided in Workshop
https://github.com/GarethWoodman/my_portfolio/tree/master/week_1/debugging_1

### 4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
#### Encapsulation is defining instance variables by creating new objects and only being able to access them through their methods. This hides the data from the user and allows smooth maintenance and modular code. 

#### SRP (Single Responsibility Purpose) - Is telling a class/object to have a single purpose. For example a Person object should only contain attributes related to person, if we were to add that Personâ€™s email address that would break the rule, instead we define Email as a separate class/object and that now has its own single responsibility.

#### Completed the Airport Challenge - adhering to OO principles and using TDD
